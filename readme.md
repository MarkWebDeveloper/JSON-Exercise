# JSON Async Exercise

This is a short JSON learning project. 

The goal of the first exercise is to print in the browser's console the titles of the data.json file. It is done using 2 methods. The first one is using the old fetch .then method. The second method is based on a newer approach using async and await.

The goal of the second exercise is to print the content of the data.json as an HTML table.
